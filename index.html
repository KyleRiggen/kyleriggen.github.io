  <h3>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</h3>
  <p>The artifact is a full stack application created in CS465. It uses a MEAN stack to make a travelers website.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components
    of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How did the enhancement improve the
    artifact? What specific skills did you demonstrate in the enhancement?</h3>
  <p>We need to have an artifact in our ePortfolio for the class so its in my ePortfolio because we need it for the
    class.</p>

  <p>It was the only artifact I had code for.</p>

  <p>The specfic components that showcase my skills would be the stuff that I
    built going through some API calls. </p>

  <p> The enhancement improved the artifact by being a fun project that could be used
    by many people as an entertainment tool to find their favorite champion and see what rank it is compaired to others.
    The core idea of my original artifact was about doing CRUD operations on travel destinations. I thank my professor
    on not forcing me to continue to enhance the CRUD operations for travel desinations. I was able to have more fun and
    learn more by building all these API calls to get some champion statistics.

  <h3>Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it?
    What challenges did you face? How did you incorporate feedback as you made changes to the artifact? How was the
    artifact improved? Which course outcomes did you partially or fully meet with your enhancements? Which do you feel
    were not met?</h3>
  <p>I learned so much during this project. This is something that I have wanted to build personally but to have a class
    that enables and helps me build it was great. There are libraries that go through rate limiting and many other
    useful tool but I was able to do all of it manually.
    things</p>
  <p>Some of the challenges I faced was handling the rate limiting of API calls. The solution is rather simple but it
    was interesting to figure out. I just had to pause each cycle of the API calling loops for a second and the rate
    limiting issue was gone. More challenges include all sorts of little things that popup when making any type of
    project. Especially at my experience level. Nothing too notable but tons of little things that can be blockers for
    hours. Then once they are fixed, you move on and forget all about making such a silly mistake.
  </p>
  <p>The artifact was imporoved with more useful content. Rather than a example website with dummy data for practice use
    only, it now has live data of useful statictic people will enjoy reading.</p>
