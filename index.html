  <h2>Kyle Riggenbach ePortfolio</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>Narratives</h2>
  <h3>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</h3>

  <p>The artifact is a full stack application created in CS465. It uses a MEAN stack to make a travelers website. It was
    created originally when I finished the CS465 class a few weeks ago.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components
    of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How did the enhancement improve the
    artifact? What specific skills did you demonstrate in the enhancement?</h3>
  <p>We need to have an artifact in our ePortfolio for the class so it's in my ePortfolio because we need it for the
    class.</p>

  <p>It was the only artifact I had code for.</p>

  <p>The specific components that showcase my skills would be the stuff that I built going through some API calls.</p>

  <p>The enhancement improved the artifact by being a fun project that could be used by many people as an entertainment
    tool to find their favorite champion and see what rank it is compared to others. The core idea of my original
    artifact was about doing CRUD operations on travel destinations. I thank my professor for not forcing me to continue
    to enhance the CRUD operations for travel destinations. I was able to have more fun and learn more by building all
    these API calls to get some champion statistics.

  <h3>Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it?
    What challenges did you face? How did you incorporate feedback as you made changes to the artifact? How was the
    artifact improved? Which course outcomes did you partially or fully meet with your enhancements? Which do you feel
    were not met?</h3>

  <p>I learned so much during this project. This is something that I have wanted to build personally but to have a class
    that enables and helps me build it was great. There are libraries that go through rate limiting and many other
    useful tools but I was able to do all of it manually. There is still much work to be done to finish the product into
    a useful state but this class enabled me to start.</p>
  <p>Some of the challenges I faced was handling the rate limiting of API calls. The solution is rather simple but it
    was interesting to figure out. I just had to pause each cycle of the API calling loops for a second and the rate
    limiting issue was gone. More challenges include all sorts of little things that popup when making any type of
    project. Especially at my experience level. Nothing too notable but tons of little things that can be blockers for
    hours. Then once they are fixed, you move on and forget all about making such a silly mistake.
  </p>
  <p>The artifact was improved with more useful content. Rather than an example website with dummy data for practice use
    only, it now has live data of useful statistics people will enjoy reading.</p>

  <h4>Course Outcomes:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support
      organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have achieved this by using Github to create a collaborative environment for my classmates and professor to
          support the work I am doing on my code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent,
      technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have achieved this by writing communications weekly that often need rewriting. There has also been oral and
          visual communication that was achieved in this class. These communications are coherent, technically sound,
          and appropriately adapted to the audience they are consumed by.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer
      science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design
      choices.
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have achieved this by producing code that solves a computing problem. The code uses algorithmic principles
          and computer science practices. The code also uses generally accepted best standards and considers design
          trade-offs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices
      for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have achieved this by using innovative techniques like those explored in the MEAN tech stack. Then they are
          also well founded techniques as the tech stack is also generally accepted as it has wide spread industry
          adoption.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose
      potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have achieved this by securing the API calls done in my code. They require an API key that is not exposed to
          the public through the collaborative environment in Github.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>Completing my coursework throughout the computer science program and developing this ePortfolio has been a great
    experience that has enhanced my skills, shaped my professional goals and values, and prepared me to enter the
    workforce with confidence!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collaborating in a Team Environment
      <ul>
        <li>
          One of the most valuable aspects of my coursework was the emphasis on teamwork with regular discussions and
          further collaboration. In several projects, such as the github collaboration course, I worked closely with
          peers to achieve our goals and learn git together.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Communicating with Stakeholders
      <ul>
        <li>
          Great communication with stakeholders is important for the success of any project. During my capstone project,
          I had the opportunity to present our progress to both technical and non-technical stakeholders such as my
          professor, classmates, and friends. This involved translating complex technical details into understandable
          terms and gathering feedback to refine the project. These interactions emphasized the importance of clear
          communication and collaboration.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Data Structures and Algorithms
      <ul>
        <li>
          A strong grasp of data structures and algorithms is great in computer science. Courses in this area challenged
          me to solve complex problems efficiently. For instance, in the computer graphics class, we developed many
          mathematical algorithms to render many different types of shapes. These algorithm not only honed my
          problem-solving skills but also highlighted the importance of selecting the right data structures and
          algorithms for different scenarios.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Software Engineering and Database Management
      <ul>
        <li>
          We took a couple database related courses. Two generally focused on NoSQL and then one on SQL. These courses
          help to provide a solid foundation for database design principles that are going to be part of almost every
          single thing I get to make moving forward. They will ensure a great understanding of data integrity,
          efficiency, and reliability which are crucial.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Security
      <ul>
        <li>
          Security is a huge concern in todayâ€™s ever connected world. We took a course on cybersecurity that introduced
          me to various aspects of securing software and networks. This class highlighted the importance of proactive
          security practices and staying updated with emerging threats.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Summary of Artifacts
      <ul>
        <li>
          I used the same artifact for all three enhancements. It was the only artifact I had the code for and my
          enhancements needed to be done on one single project. They covered everything that was required in that one
          project as well so it worked out. The artifact I worked with was a MEAN stack website that originally was
          created to go through CRUD operations for managing travel destinations.
